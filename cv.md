### About myself:

While still at school, I began to be interested in programming. One of our teachers made an elective to learn the basics of HTML. It didn't last long, but it was then that I decided that I wanted to connect my future profession with programming.

I looked for myself in different professions. For example: I was a table tennis coach and also opened my own small online clothing store.
Then it was time to go to university. By that time, my older brother, sorting through different professions, came into the IT field. Without hesitation, I chose BSUIR.

I am currently in my 2nd year of study. The university itself has a rather outdated curriculum, so I began to look for some courses for myself. My friend invited me to these courses, it is more fun to study together and learn something new.

I am quite assiduous and grasp quickly, so I think that I will be able to become a good specialist in this field.

### Code example:
**"Handshake problem" KATA fron Codewars:** Johnny is a farmer and he annually holds a beet farmers convention "Drop the beet".

Every year he takes photos of farmers handshaking. Johnny knows that no two farmers handshake more than once. He also knows that some of the possible handshake combinations may not happen.

However, Johnny would like to know the minimal amount of people that participated this year just by counting all the handshakes.

Help Johnny by writing a function, that takes the amount of handshakes and returns the minimal amount of people needed to perform these handshakes (a pair of farmers handshake only once).

```js
function getParticipants(handshakes)
{
  let count = 1, hsh = 1;
  while (hsh <= handshakes) 
  {
    count += 1;
    hsh += ((count - 1));
  }
  return  count;
} 
```
